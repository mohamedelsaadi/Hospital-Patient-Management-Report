ğŸš‘ Optimizing Hospital Patient Management with Power BI ğŸ“Š

I recently built a Hospital Patient Management Dashboard in Power BI to analyze key metrics, optimize patient care, and improve hospital efficiency. Here are some key takeaways:

ğŸ”¹ 40K patients, $1B total billing
ğŸ”¹ 16 days average length of stay â€“ Can we optimize this?
ğŸ”¹ Private rooms drive higher revenue than Semi-Private ones
ğŸ”¹ Pediatric patient numbers are missing â€“ Data gap or service gap?
ğŸ”¹ Zuniga-White leads in patient volume & billing â€“ What makes it more efficient?
ğŸ”¹ Abnormal & inconclusive test results need deeper analysis

ğŸ’¡ Next Steps:
âœ… Reduce patient stay duration with better workflow & resource allocation
âœ… Improve semi-private room revenue strategies
âœ… Investigate variations in hospital performance
âœ… Enhance insurance insights to maximize reimbursements
